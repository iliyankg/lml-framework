# lml-framework
A simple project for me to Learn Machine Learning (LML). Both at the high level of api creation and low level of architecture specific optimizations.

# Intended roadmap
1. Implement core ML algorithms and operations with minimal external dependencies in Python | learn the math
2. Implement basic framework to create and train models | learn/create the workflow
3. Implement visualizers, debugging and other tools to better illustrate the under the hood workings of ML training and inference | make it more useble and debuggable
3. Migrate to C/C++ implementations of core algorithms, opperations and allocations targeting my own CPU | learn the lower level details and key aspects of optimizations on different architectures
4. Add CUDA support for GPU acceleration
5. Add support for other architectures (e.g. ARM)

# Disclamer
This project is intended for educational purposes (my own). It is not intended to be used in production or for any other purpose. It is not intended to be a replacement for any existing ML framework.
