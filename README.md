# lml-framework
A simple project for me to Learn Machine Learning (LML). From the high level of api creation to low level of architecture specific optimizations and the math behind it all.

Inspired by the initiative and endevours of others, existing frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow and sheer morbid curiosity.

# Intended High level roadmap
1. Implement core ML algorithms and operations with minimal external dependencies in Python | learn the math
2. Implement basic framework to create and train models | learn/create the workflow
3. Implement visualizers, debugging and other tools to better illustrate the under the hood workings of ML training and inference | make it more useable and debuggable
3. Migrate to C/C++ implementations of core algorithms, opperations and allocations targeting my own CPU | learn the lower level details and key aspects of optimizations on different architectures
4. Add CUDA support for GPU acceleration
5. Add support for other architectures (e.g. ARM)

# Disclamer
This project is intended for (my own) educational purposes. It is not meant to be used in production or for any other purpose.
